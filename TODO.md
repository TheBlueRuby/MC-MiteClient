# To-Do

## Features

- Add Crosshair Mod
  - Dev build hides default crosshair but doesn't show custom one
- Possibly add Replay Mod
- Add lunar-like armor HUD
- Add forge mod support

## Bugs

- Joining a server with TargetHUD active sometimes will crash the game (maybe because of too many entities targeted?)
- Resource pack manager crashes game on opening it (NullPointerException)

## Other
- Test AutoGG
- Check MiteClient tag positioning
