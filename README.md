# Mite Client for Minecraft Java Edition
This is a work-in-progress Minecraft client that I am using to learn Java, inspired by Lunar and LabyMod. 

Requires Official Launcher

***REQUIRES A PREMIUM MINECRAFT JAVA EDITION ACCOUNT!!***

***WILL NOT WORK WITH CRACKED ACCOUNTS***

## Jar Installer

Download the installer from its repo [here](https://github.com/TheBlueRuby/MiteClient-Installer-JavaFX)

Run MiteClient-Installer.jar using a Java 8 Runtime with JavaFX

Tested to work on JRE 1.8.0_271


## Electron-based Installer
Work-In-Progress, will eventually be put on https://github.com/TheBlueRuby/MiteClient-Installer-Electron

## Manual Installation

### First Time Installation

Copy the MiteClient folder of the latest MiteClient zip (download from releases page) into the "versions" folder in your .minecraft folder.

To run, create a new installation on the official minecraft launcher and set the version to "release MiteClient"

After that, click play

### Updating

Copy MiteClient.jar from the latest MiteClient.zip or the separate download (1.0.2-1 and newer)

Place it in the MiteClient folder in the .minecraft\versions folder. Overwrite any files as they will be older versions
