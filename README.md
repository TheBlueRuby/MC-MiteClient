# Mite Client for Minecraft Java Edition
This is a work-in-progress minecraft client that I am using to learn java, though i will probably just use lunar. 

It currently requires the official minecraft launcher to play, though I am working on a custom one.

***REQUIRES A PREMIUM MINECRAFT JAVA EDITION ACCOUNT!!***

***WILL NOT WORK WITH CRACKED ACCOUNTS***
## Installation

Copy the MiteClient folder of the MiteClient zip (download from releases page) into the "versions" folder in your .minecraft folder.

To run, create a new installation on the official minecraft launcher and set the version to "release MiteClient"

After that, click play
